    <h2 id="p1" class="post">Blossoms Festival</h2>
    <h6>Fluorest, Terrania (XXX A.G.)</h6>
    <p>The Blossoms Festival has just concluded but bless, do I have a lot to share. For the uninitiated, the Blossoms Festival is an annual festival in Terrania that celebrates the coming of the new year. During it's 5-day span, many artists and craftsman show off their work from the previous year and food stands pop up in ubiquity in the capital city of Fluorest. The Blossoms Festival as its named after, lines up with the blooming of the cherry blossoms that are planted around the city. Those who wish to see their true beauty should make the voyage to Terrania to see it.</p>

    <h2 id="p2" class="post">Peace or Ceasefire? </h2>
    <h6>Magnolia (XXXX)</h6>
    <p>The world is in a hectic and volatile state. However, beyond the muddling darkness there is a shimmer of light. The Great War seems to come to a close after Geona's split from the main continent. The many Geic lives sacrificed to effectively isolate the nation seems to have put the world on ice, which ironic considering how many lives have already been lost in the war. Attacks and raids seemed to have slowed down worldwide and people are starting to question whethor or not we've finally reached a resolution. We have already reached a truce with Ventyria and peace between the three warring nations left seems imminent. Only time will tell, but let us pray for the end of this dreadful Great War.
